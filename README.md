# Shortstop_Outs
This is a project that I worked on when I was applying to a position for a team within the MLB. The question was, "Which shortstop converted the most outs above average?" I did all of my work in R. I started by cleaning the data and got rid of any plays that had an error, or a base hit (essentially anything that didn't result in an out). I then found the average number of outs that each shortstop was involved in (either assisting or making the out). Then I got rid of all of the SS that didn't have a number of outs that was above the average. Finally, I sorted the list of the remaining SS by the number of outs they had above the average. In this final list, I also included the number of opportunities they had and the actual number of outs they made.
